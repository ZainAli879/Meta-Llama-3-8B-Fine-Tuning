# Meta-Llama-3-8B-Fine-Tuning
This project provides an easy way to fine-tune the Llama 3 model for text generation. It includes model optimization using BitsAndBytes, a simple text generation pipeline, and a Streamlit-based web interface for user interaction. Ideal for researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts looking to customize Llama 3 for their specific needs

üìå Features
‚úÖ Fine-tune Llama 3 (8B model) for better text generation
‚úÖ Uses BitsAndBytes for optimized performance
‚úÖ Streamlit UI for easy interaction
‚úÖ Supports quantization to reduce memory usage

üõ†Ô∏è Installation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
You need to install some Python libraries before using the project. The main ones are:

Transformers (for working with the Llama 3 model)
BitsAndBytes (for optimizing the model)
Accelerate (for better performance)
Streamlit (for a web-based UI)
You can install these using pip.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Hugging Face API Token
To access the Llama 3 model, you need a Hugging Face API token. You can store it in a file or set it as an environment variable.

üöÄ How to Use
1Ô∏è‚É£ Load the Model
The model and tokenizer are loaded using the Hugging Face library.
Quantization is applied to make the model run faster with less memory.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Text
You can enter a prompt, and the model will generate a response based on its training.
The output is optimized for better text quality.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Streamlit Web App
The project includes a Streamlit UI, so you can interact with the model in a simple web-based interface.
